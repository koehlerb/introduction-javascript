# Assignent and Project Guidelines

1. Each assignment is due by the end of the due day. No assignment
   work is accepted after the deadline unless it's pre-arranged
   with the instructor for an acceptable reasons, typically a
   medical conditions or a family emergency.
1. A good number of assignments will be auto-graded. For those ones,
   make sure you follow the instruction accurately. The last
   assignment(s) will be assessed manually by the instructor.
   For those assignment(s), make sure they fulfill the
   following code format and validation requirements:
   1. "use strict" is added at the beginning of all JavaScript files.
   1. Each JavaScript, html, and css file that you create should have
      a file header comment to state the author, the assignment number,
      and the date last modified.
   1. Each JS function / method you create should have a comment about
      its parameters, return value, as well as the design steps where
      deemed necessary.
   1. All JavaScript, HTML and CSS documents should be formatted
      properly so that they are easy to read.
   1. All web pages should be tested with a web browser. Provide
      the screenshot(s) that display the JavaScript execution result.
   1. All HTML, CSS, JS, and other resource files for the assignment
      should be pushed to GitHub. Validate with the W3C validator all
      new and modified html code and CSS documents. Report the validation
      result with screenshots.
      NOTE: The HTML validation should include the html code produced
      by JavaScript at runtime. Reference the method presented on the
      [FAQ page](/docs/FAQ) to do it.
1. GitHub Version Control.
   1. Before you start each assignment, click on the GitHub link in
      the assignment instruction to clone/create your initial assignment
      repository on GitHub; afterward, use GitHub DeskTop to clone it to
      your local machine, then add and modify files as needed to your
      website using VS Code.
   1. During the working process on the assignment, your will periodically
      commit / push the in-progress work to the local repository and to
      GitHub.
   1. After completing the assignment, you will push the final version
      of the assignment to GitHub.
      If you need to refresh GitHub version control operations, the [GitHub
      workshop video](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_G_0vXpJ7U7dgNNHdYXJo1BqSBv5oDiP5gyjerm_yQ) and a simple GitHub and GitHub Desktop work-flow are
      posted here for your reference.
1. There is no paper printout required in this course. However, you do
   need to print out the following into a pdf file and upload it to
   GitHub together with your final assignment files:
   1. Validation report of all new and modified html code and css files.
   1. Browser testing report for the new and modified pages.
   1. Summary and feedback form.
