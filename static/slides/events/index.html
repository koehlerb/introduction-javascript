## Events and Event Handling
---
### Objectives
* Describe the types of events
* Add, use, and remove event listeners
* Use event object
* Identify where the event occurred
* Change the default behaviour of an event
* Describe event propagation models – bubbling and capturing
* Delegate event handling
* Timer events and use
---
### Study Guide
1. Walk through the lecture notes to get the overall concepts.
1. Read the recommended online materials for more detailed
   explanations and examples
---
### Study Guide
3. Use of examples:
      * Examine the html code for the page structure
      * Examine the CSS file to see how the page is presented
      * Examine the JS file to learn the code. First, you need to understand
        what it is trying to do then learn how it gets the job done.
      * Use browser developer tools to step though the code execution
        process
      * Modify the code to do similar or different jobs
---
### Introduction
* Events handling makes it possible for the user to interact
  with your webpage. Pay close attention to the following:
  1. What an event is.
  1. What type of events may occur on a webpage and your JS
     code can respond.
  1. What an event listener is and what an event handler is.
  1. How to set up an event handler and to make it to do
     certain jobs.
---
### Events
* Events are something happened in the browser
  window, that are recognized and can be
  responded by JavaScript.
* You can write JavaScript code to execute when
  an event fires -- responds to the events such as
  user actions. So, your website becomes
  interactive.
---
## Event Types (Samples)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
---
### Mouse Events
* click and dblclick: click always occurs before dblclick.
* mousedown and mouseup: pressed / released on an
  element.
* mouseenter and mouseleave: onto or off the element.
* mouseover: onto the element or one of its children.
* mouseout: off the element or one of its children.
* mousemove: moved over an element, fired
  continuously.
* select
---
### User Interface or DOM Events
These events occurs on window and other objects.
We most often respond to them on window object.
* load - page finished loading, including all resources,
  different from DOMContentLoaded.
* unload - page is unloading.
* error - when a resource can't be loaded or used.
* resize - document view has been resized.
* scroll - document or an element has been scrolled.
---
### Keyboard Events
* keydown
* keyup
* keypress - deprecated, use keydown or
  beforeinput
---
### Drag and Drop Events
* drag: element is being dragged (once / 350ms)
* dragend: drag is being ended
* dragenter: dragged element enters a valid drop target
* dragstart: user starts dragging an element
* dragleave: dragged element leaves a valid drop target
* dragover: element is being dragged over a valid drop
  target (once / 350ms).
* drop: element is dropped on a valid drop target.
---
### Pointer Events
This is a new type of events. It covers mouse, touch and
other pointing device events.

| pointerdown | pointerenter       |
|-------------|--------------------|
| pointerup   | pointerleave       |
| pointermove | pointercancel      |
| pointerover | gotpointercapture  |
| pointerout  | lostpointercapture |

https://javascript.info/pointer-events
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events/Using_Pointer_Events
---
### Focus and Clipboard Events
Focus Events
* focus / focusin: An element has received focus,
  typically for a form control.
* blur/ focusout: An element has lost focus
  (focus and blur don't bubble).

Clipboard Events
* cut
* copy
* paste
---
### Form Events
* input - fires when value changes for input, select,
  or textarea
* submit
* reset

Reference:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
---
### Responding to Events
* Many events could occur on an element but by
  default JS doesn’t respond to any of them.
* To make your JS to take an action in response to
  an event, you need to explicitly specify what
  event to respond, for example,
```html
<img src="..." alt="..." onclick="eventHandler()">
```
* An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript
  that waits for an event to occur.
---
### Event Handler
* An event handler would be the actual JS code
  responding to the event.
```javascript
function eventHandler() {
    alert('click event occurred');
}
```
---
### Bind Event Handler to Element
Three ways to bind an event handler to an
element:
1. HTML event handler attributes
1. Traditional DOM event handlers
1. DOM Level 2 event listeners
---
### HTML Event Handler Attributes
Issues with this approach:
1. JS code is mixed with the HTML.
1. Difficult to find where these event are
   declared as they are buried in html code.
1. Only one event handler for each event-type
   can be attached to an element.
1. The JS code is in a string, error prone with
   apostrophes and quote marks.
---
### Traditional DOM Event Handlers
```javascript
let el = document.querySelector('#banner');
el.onclick = domEventHandler; //no ()
//
function domEventHandler(){
    alert('Click event occurred. This Response is from domEventHandler function!');
}
```
---
### DOM2 Event Listener (Recommended)
* Syntax:
```javascript
el.addEventListener('event', handler[,option]);
```
* Example:
```javascript
let el = document.getElementById('id');
el.addEventListener('click', dom2EventHandler);
//2nd parameter is the function name but NO ()
function dom2EventHandler(){
    alert('Response from dom2EventHandler!');
}
```
---
### DOM2 Event Listener (Recommended)
* The listener can be an in-place function or an
  anonymous function:
```javascript
el.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Response from dom2EventHandler!');
});
```
* It doesn't have the problems presented with
  other two approaches, e.g., multiple
  handlers can be used for the same event
  type.
---
### DOM2 Event Listener
* Often you would like to wait until the page is
  loaded then to take certain actions.
* Example
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load',initialization);
//
function initialization(){
    //Initialization code;
}
```
* With this code, the script tag linking to
  external js file would be less location sensitive.
---
### DOM2 Event Listener Summary
* Select the element node that may have
  certain events your script should respond to,
  e.g., a button or image.
* Indicate the event , e.g., click, on the selected
  node that will trigger a response.
* State the code you want to run, e.g., start,
  when the event occurs.
* Define the handler function, e.g., start()
---
### Callback Functions
* A function is often referred to as a callback
  function when it's passed into another
  function as an argument to be invoked later
  inside the receiving function.
* Event handler function is a callback function.
---
### Event Object
* When an event occurs, the event handler is
  called automatically, and the event object is
  available as an argument to the event
  handler.
* However, to use the event object in the event
  handling function, you must make it a
  parameter explicitly in the function
  definition.
---
### Event Object
```javascript
el.addEventListener('click', dom2EventHandler);
//
function dom2EventHandler(e){
    alert(`Event ${e.type}. Response from dom2EventHandler`);
}
```
---
### Event Object Properties
* `type` - e.g., click, focus, etc.
* `cancellable`
* `target`: the element on which the event
  occurred. So, the element properties can be
  used such as tagName , class, etc.
---
### Event Object Properties - Location
* `screenX` and `screenY`: relative to the upper left
  corner of the screen where the event took place.
* `clientX` and `clientY`: relative to the upper left
  corner of the browser window's content area.
* `pageX` and `pageY`: relative to the upper left corner
  of the document.
* Test their differences with the browser window in
  different sizes, with and without scroll bars visible.
* note - all these measurements returns a number in px
  but when you use them in CSS, px must be added.
---
### Screen Information
* This example webpage shows it clearly,
  http://www.javascriptbook.com/code/c06/position.html
* To see the difference between screenX/Y and
  other two pairs, just size the browser window
  to cover a portion of the screen, then move
  the mouse.
* To see the difference between clientX/Y and
  pageX/Y, scroll the page down beyond the
  current screen , the move the mouse pointer
  on the page.
---
### Remove Event Listeners
```javascript
target.removeEventListener(type,listener);
```
* This method syntax is the same as
  `addEventListener()`
* It's a matter of when and how to use it. For
  example, if you have an event handler to run
  once, you may remove it at the end of the
  event handler function, OR you can make a
  button to add or remove an event handler.
---
### Stop Default Behavior
* Some elements have default behavior
  associated with certain events such as `<a>`
  and submit.
* Often the default behavior is not what you
  want.
* preventDefault() method of the event object can
  be used inside the event handler function to
  stop the default behavior.
---
### Stop Default Behavior
```javascript
const brokenLink = document.getElementById('broken');
//
brokenLink.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  alert('Broken Link!');
});
```
Note - Since users may expect certain behavior, use this with caution.
---
### Event Propagation
* Event propagation is the order that the
  events fire on the element and its containers.
* There are two forms of event propagation:
  bubbling and capturing.
  * Bubbling: the event fires from the element that the
    event occurred on to its containers until the root.
  * Capturing: event fires on the root element first, then
    propagates downward.
  * http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing
---
### Event Propagation
* When you click on an element, clicking event
  occurs on all its containing elements.
* With the example on the next slide, if you click
  on a hyperlink within a `<li>` element, you're
  also clicking on the `<li>`, `<ul>`, `<body>` and
  `<html>` elements.
---
### Event Propagation
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><meta charset="utf-8" /></head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="locations.html">Locations</a></li>
      <li><a href="menu.html">Menu</a></li>
      <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
---
### Event Propagation
* You may add an event listener at each level to
  observe the propagation order.
* To reverse the default event propagation
  order from bubbling to capturing, use the 3rd
  parameter in `addEventListener()` and set
  it to `true`.
---
### Stop Event Propagation
* Occasionally, you may want to stop the event
  propagation after the event is handled at a
  lower-level element.
* How to do it? Use the event object's
  stopPropagation()method.
* Where? At the end of the event handler.
* Caution: Don't incidentally stop other event's
  propagation if multiple events share the same
  handler.
---
### Event Delegation
* All modern browsers support the bubble model.
* As an event occurs on an element it will also
  be sensed by its parent and grandparent, etc.
* We don't need to add an event listener on
  each of the children. Instead, we just listen on
  the parent or grandparent—save code &
  improve efficiency.
* How to do it?
  Place an event listener on a container
  element.
---
### Event Delegation
This code delegates the first ul on the page to
handle click event occurred on its li children.
```javascript
let el = document.querySelector('ul');
el.addEventListener('click', delegate);
//
function delegate(event) {
  alert('event occurred on ' +
        event.target.tagName + 
        ' but handled by its parent ' + 
        this.tagName);
}
```
---
### Event Delegation
* As the example demonstrated, although
  the event is handled at a higher level, the
  event's target property still points to the
  original element that received the event.
* `"this"` refers to the element that the
  event listener is attached to.
---
### Event Delegation
Not only you can use event object to retrieve info of the
element that the event occurred on, but also set its
attributes.
```javascript
function delegate(event) {
  alert('event occurred on ' +
        event.target.tagName + 
        ' but handled by its parent ' + 
        this.tagName);
  e.target.className = 'myclass';
}
```
---
## Event Example - Drag & Drop
---
### Drag and Drop
* To make an element draggable, all that is required is to
  set its `draggable` attribute to `true`.
* Dragging alone may not be as useful; often you
  need to drop it somewhere.
* You often need to write event listeners to detect
  and control the various parts of the drag-and-
  drop process.
---
### Drag & Drop Example
1. Only a few element types can be dragged
  by default. To make an element draggable,
  set its `draggable` attribute to `true`.
1. By default, an element cannot be dragged
  into or dropped into another element. Use
  `event.preventDefault()` to change the
  default behavior.
1. The receiving element needs to add the
  dragged element as a child.
---
### Drag & Drop Examples - HTML
Add two div elements to the page:
```html
<div id="dragEle" draggable="true">
  Drag me!
</div>
<div id="dropTarget">Drop here!</div>
```
Add CSS as shown on the next slides
---
### Drag & Drop Examples - CSS
```CSS
#dragEle {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: yellow;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
  cursor: move;
} 
#dropTarget {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```
---
### Drag & Drop Examples - JS
```javascript
let dragElement = document.getElementById('dragEle');
let dropTarget = document.getElementById('dropTarget');
//
dragElement.addEventListener('dragstart', dragStart);
dropTarget.addEventListener('dragover', dragOver);
dropTarget.addEventListener('drop', dragDrop);
//
function dragStart(e) {
  e.dataTransfer.setData('text', e.target.id);
};
```
---
### Drag & Drop Examples - JS
```javascript
function dragOver(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
};
//
function dragDrop(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  let data = e.dataTransfer.getData('text');
  dropTarget.append(document.getElementById(data));
};
```
---
### Drag & Drop Examples
* Here are two drag & drop examples
  1. https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html5&file=drag-and-drop-elements
  1. https://javascript.info/mouse-drag-and-drop
* The first example uses HTML 5 drag & drop API.
* The second example uses plain JS Code with
  position. It's more flexible but the code is more
  complex.
---
## Timer Events
---
### Timer Functions and Events
* The following statement will
  trigger a timer event after `timeInterval`
  milliseconds:
```javascript
window.setTimeout(theFunction,timeInterval)
```
* Then `theFunction` will be called as the event
  handler. It's also called a callback function.
---
### Timer Functions and Events
* The callback function could be an anonymous
  function with arrow notation.
```javascript
let timer = setTimeout(()=>alert('Time\'s Up!'), 10000);
```
* What's the use of the assignment?
  The function returns an instance number that represents
  the timer.
* With the instance number, the timer can be
  cancelled before it fires:
```javascript
window.clearTimeout(timer);
```
---
### Timer Functions and Events
* The `window.setInterval()` method works like
  `setTimeout()`, except that it will repeatedly
  trigger a timer event and invoke the callback
  function after every given number of milliseconds.
```javascript
let n = 10;
const timer =
setInterval(count,1000);
function count(){
    console.log(n--);
    if(n&lt;=0){clearInterval(timer);}
}
```
---
### Exercises
* Display the self-updated date and time on the page
  footer using the Date object and timer event / function.
* Date() returns the system date and time string
* `let date = new Date();` will create a Date object and assign
  the reference to date variable.
* Many methods are available to Date object for retrieving
* year, month, date, day, hour, minute, and second.
* https://javascript.info/date
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#examples
---
