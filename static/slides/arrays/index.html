## Arrays
---
### Objectives
* explain array concepts
* declare and populate arrays
* manage array contents
* iterate through an array
* use common array methods
* work with m-dimensional arrays
* incorporate arrays in a web application
---
### Arrays
* An array is a special type of object. It stores a list
  of values under a single name.
* Create an empty array:
```javascript
let myArray = []; //array literal notation
let myArray = new Array(); //not recommended
```
* Create an array with initial values:
```javascript
let myArray = ['item1','item2','item3']; // or
let myArray = [10,20,30];
```
* A JS array can contain different types of data,
  even another array:
```javascript
const mixedArray = [null,1,[],'two', true];
```
---
### Using Array Index
* How to access an item in an array?
  Using its index value. The first item's index is 0;
  example:
```javascript
alert(myArray[2]);
```
* Adding/replacing a value in an array
```javascript
myArray[0] = 10;
```
* Technically you can add a value to any position in
  an array, e.g., `myArray[10] = 100;`
* The index positions that don't have a value
  assigned will have the value "undefined".
---
### Using Array Index
* You may sometimes use a string as index. When a
  string is used for array index, it's called an associative
  array.
* JavaScript doesn't support associative arrays.
* When a string is used for an array index, it will
  change the nature of the array (to an object).
  Afterward, some array methods may not work
  anymore.
* ***To keep it simple, we will only use numbers for
  array indices.***
---
### Array Property: length
* Array length property: technically, it returns the
  value of last index + 1.
* If the array has unfilled positions, the length value
  doesn't represent the number of initialized values
  in the array, for example,
```javascript
let myArray = [10,20,30];
myArray[10] = 100;
```
* `myArray.length` returns 11. There are 7 empty
  "undefined" elements from position 3 to 9.
---
### Array Operations
* Delete a value from an array:
```javascript
delete myArray[2];
```
* The value at index 2 will be removed and the
  space becomes empty.
* Assign array element values to variables - other
  than the index method, you can also do these:
```javascript
//assign 1st 3 values to a, b, c
let [a, b, c] = arr;
const [x, y, z] = [10,20,30];// assign
// 10, 20, 30 to x, y, z respectively
[x,y] = [y,x]; //swap x, y values
```
---
### Array Methods
* `concat`: merges elements in multiple arrays and
  returns the merged result; the calling array
  object content is not changed.
* `toString`: returns the string of all items in the
  array separated by comma ,.
* `indexOf`: returns the index of first matching item
  in the array. If no match, returns -1.
* `lastIndexOf`: returns the index of last matching
  item in the array.
---
### Array Methods
* `push`: adds a new value to the end of the array
* `pop`: removes the last item from an array
* `shift`: removes the first item in the array
* `unshift`: inserts a new item to the beginning of
  the array

---
### Array Methods
```javascript
let arr = [10];  //create an array with value 10;
arr.push(20);    //arr has [10,20]
arr.push(30);    //arr has [10,20,30]
arr.pop();       //returns 30, arr has [10,20]
arr.shift();     //returns 10, arr has [20]
arr.unshift(40); //arr has [40,20]

let arr1 = [50];
let arr2 = arr.concat(arr1);
//what are in arr, arr1, and arr2?
```
---
### Array Methods
* `join()`: turns the array into a string with all
  array elements separated by commas like
  `toString()` method, but you can provide a
  separator string to `join()`.
```javascript
let arr = ['John', 'Bob', 'Mar'];
let str = arr.join();  // str has “John,Bob,Mary”
str = arr.join('; '); // str has “John; Bob; Mary”
```
---
### Array Methods
* `slice(index1, index2)`: returns a subarray
  including the element at indext1 to element right
  before index2.
* The original array is not affected.
```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const arr2 = arr.slice(1,3);
//arr2 has 20, 30, arr umchanged
```
---
### Array Methods
* You can also give slice negative numbers as
  arguments, which will be treated as offset from
  the end of the array.
  `-index+array.length` is used
  to replace the `-index`.
```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const arr2 = arr.slice(-2,3);
// is equivalent to:
const arr2 = arr.slice((-2+4),3);
// arr2 has 30, arr is unchanged
```
---
### Array Methods
* Replace, insert, and remove values:
```text
splice(startIndex, deleteCount, newItemsToAdd);
```
* Example:
```javascript
let arr = [10, 15, 30, 40];
arr.splice(1,1,20); //returns 15; arr:[10,20,30,40]
arr.splice(2,0,50); //arr: [10,20,50,30,40]
arr.splice(1,1);    //returns 20, arr:[10,50,30,40]
arr.splice(2);      //returns [30,40]; arr:[10,50]
```
---
### Sorting Arrays
* `sort()`: sorts array elements alphabetically.
* `reverse()`: reverse elements sequence in the
  array
* these methods operate "in-place"
* How do you reverse sort an array?
---
### Sorting Arrays
* The built-in sort method sorts the items in the array
  into alphabetical order - treating all elements as
  strings
* This is fine with string arrays but not for numerical
  arrays:
```javascript
let arr = [1, 3, 40, 5, 25, 15, 7];
arr.sort();
// arr now has [1, 15, 25, 3, 40, 5, 7]
```
---
### Sorting Arrays
* To sort a numerical array properly, we need to
  define a function and pass it into the sort method:
```javascript
function numOrder(a, b){
    return a - b;
}
arr.sort(numOrder);
// arr now has [1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 25, 40]
```
* To reverse the sorting order, just reverse the
  sequence of the parameter order in the
  function's return statement.
---
### Sorting Arrays
* How does `arr.sort(numOrder)` work?
* Sorting is a process of repetitively comparing 2
  values in the array to determine their order.
* When comparing the values, JS will pass them
  to function `numOrder()`.
* Use ascending order sort as an example: if
  `numOrder` returns a value &lt; 0, a will be
  placed in front of b in the array; if it returns a
  value &gt; 0, a will be placed after b in the array; if
  it returns 0, there is no difference.
---
### Iterating through Arrays
* Several methods can be used to do it
* `for ... of` statement:
```javascript
const colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'];
for (const color of colors) {
    console.log(`Color is ${color}`)
};
```
---
### Iterating through Arrays
* Another method is the `for ... in` statement.
* The same example can be written using the
  `for ... in` statement:
```javascript
const colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'];
for (const i in colors) {
    console.log(`Color is ${colors[i]}`)
};
```
* `for ... of` and `for ... in` are similar statements but
  note that i in `for ... in` is the array index.
---
### Iterating through Arrays
* `forEach()` method
  * it accepts a function name as argument.
  * The function can have up to 3 arguments - the value at
    the index, the index, and the array. The last two are
    optional.
  * The function parameter is typically called a callback
    function.
* https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp
---
### Iterating through Arrays
```javascript
const colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'];

colors.forEach(showColor);

function showColor(color, index) {
    console.log(`Color at index ${index} is ${color}`)
};
```
---
### Array Assignment
* Array is a reference type, i.e., when
  you create an array, you create a
  variable whose value is a reference
  to the data area of the array.
* When assigning an array to another
  array variable, only the reference to
  the data area is assigned.
---
### Array Assignment
```javascript
let arr1 = [20, 30];
let arr2 = arr1;
```
![array alias](alias.png)
* If you change arr1 data, arr2 data will
  be changed as well.
---
### Array Applications
* Present the data of an array on a webpage as a
  table or list
* How?
* Make each element of the array a row in the
  table or an item in the list 
* Use `for ... of` or `for ... in` to do it
---
### Array map Method – Optional
* The `map()` method also iterates over an array and
  takes a function as a parameter that is invoked on
  each item in the array.
* It returns a new array that replaces each value with
  the return value of the callback function:

```javascript
function square(x) {return x * x;}

const numbers=[1, 2, 3];

console.log(numbers.map(square));
```
---
### Array reduce Method
* The `reduce()` method iterates over each value in the
  Array. It cumulatively combines each value and
  then returns just a single accumulated result.
* It takes a callback argument that is used to combine
  each value of the array with the running total.
* The callback usually takes 2 arguments, the
  cumulative result and the array element value at
  each index.
---
### Array reduce Method
```
function sumFunc(result,nextValue) {
    return result + nextValue;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let sum = numbers.reduce(sumFunc);
```
* In the example, result is the accumulator starting with
  the value of the first array element, by default.
* By the end, sum will have the accumulated total of
  all values in the array, 15.
* In addition to the callback function, reduce() takes
  another argument for the initial value of the
  accumulator
