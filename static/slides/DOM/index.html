## Scripting with DOM
---
### Objectives
* Explain the DOM tree structure of a web page
* Describe the DOM tree node and related concepts
* Select element(s) using DOM query methods
* Retrieve and update DOM element info
* Add, change, and remove an element
* Add, change, and remove an element's attributes
---
### Introduction 
* The topics of this lesson are fundamental for
  understanding JavaScript and webpage
  interactions.
* The main topic of the lesson is Document
  Object Model (DOM) and its manipulation with
  JS
* The general approach is:
  * Select the element and retrieve info
  * Do something to the selected element - 
    add/update/delete
---
### DOM and JavaScript
* DOM and JavaScript are separate things that
  are moderated by different standardization
  bodies.
* They don't belong to each other, but they are
  closely related.
* Browsers create a model of an HTML page
  based on DOM.
* JavaScript accesses / updates HTML pages
  using DOM.
---
### DOM Tree
* DOM represents an HTML document as a
  network of connected nodes that form a tree-
  like structure.
* The document tree starts with a document
  node, which has a single child, html node.
* Everything on a web page is treated as a
  node - elements, text, or attributes.

### DOM Tree Example
![DOM tree example](DOM-tree.png)
---
### DOM Node Types
* Each item in DOM tree is called a NODE.
* A document may contain many types of nodes,
  but we typically deal with 4 types:
  1. *document node* - one per html page(nodeType 9)
  1. *element node* (nodeType 1)â€”most common.
  1. An element node may also have a *text node*
     (nodeType 3)
  1. An element node may also have *attribute nodes* (nodeType 2)
* An element could also have other element nodes as
  children.

### DOM Tree Example 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>To-Do List</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My To Do List</h1>
    <ol id="toDoList">
      <li>Go to class in the morning</li>
      <li>Go to work in the afternoon</li>
      <li>Complete the homework</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="toDoNotes">Make sure all these are 
        completed by 8pm so I can
        play the online game!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
---
### DOM Tree Example 
![DOM tree example](DOM-tree2.png)
---
### DOM Tree Example
* This page has a good discussion and illustration
  of the DOM tree with examples:
* https://javascript.info/dom-nodes
---
### Navigating the DOM Tree 
* The `Node` object has several properties and
  methods for navigating around the DOM tree.
* Once you have a reference to an element, you
  can walk along the tree to find other nodes.
---
### childNodes and Children Properties
* Each node has a property `childNodes`, which
  represents the collection of its immediate
  children, including the whitespace text nodes.
* You can use it to access information about the
  children of a DOM node.
* the `children` property returns all element nodes
  that are children of the current node, i.e.,
  whitespace text nodes are excluded.
* Their difference can be illustrated with an `ol`
  element.
---
### childNodes and children Properties
* View the [DOMOps.html](/demos/week-09-DOM/DOMops.html) page in a browser
* Go to the Developer Tools Console tab
* Run these statements:
```javascript
let ol = document.querySelector('ol');
ol.children;
```
* Then enter:
```javascript
ol.childNodes;
```
* You will see they have different content.
---
### Navigating DOM Tree
* `firstChild` could be an empty text node.
* `firstElementChild` is the first tagged node.
* `lastChild` and `lastElementChild` properties:
  similar to the pair above.
* Other properties might be useful as well such
  as `parentNode`, `nextSibling`, and
  `previousSibling`.
---
### DOM Tree Operations
* A main purpose of client-side JS code is to
  program and manipulate various nodes in a
  DOM tree.
* Basic operations are:
  * getting the node(s)
  * changing their contents
  * adding new nodes, and
  * removing existing nodes.
---
## DOM Queries
---
### Getting Elements
* To access and update the HTML, first you select
  the element(s).
* We use ***DOM queries*** to access DOM
  elements.
* Some queries return one element, and others
  return a list of elements.
---
### Getting Elements - Legacy Methods
* Legacy methods can still be used to access
  certain elements on a page, such as:
  1. `document.body`
  1. `document.images`: returns a nodelist
  1. `document.links`: returns a nodelist of all `<a>`  
      and `<area>` elements that have an `href`
      attribute
  1. document.forms
* All these except for #1 returns a list of
  elements.
---
### Getting Elements - Legacy Methods
* A list of elements is also called a nodelist,
  which is like an array.
* You can use index notation to access each
  node.
```javascript
const n = document.links.length
//
for (let i=0; i < n; i++) {
    let node = document.links[i];
    console.log(node.tagName + " " + node.id);
}
```
---
### DOM Queries
* Some DOM queries return one node.
* `getElementById(id)` returns a reference to the
  element with the id specified, or null.
```javascript
const h1 = document.getElementById('title');
h1.textContent = 'Welcome!';
```
* NOTE - id value is case sensitive.
---
### DOM Queries
* Many DOM queries return a nodelist.
* `getElementsByTagName(tagName)` returns a
  nodelist of all elements with the tagName;
  the list is empty if no match is found.
```javascript
const list = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
alert(list[0].innerHTML);
```
---
### DOM Queries
* `getElementsByClassName(className)` returns
  a nodelist of all elements that have the class
  as specified, or an empty list if no match
  is found
```javascript
let items = document.getElementsByClassName('course');
alert(items[0].innerHTML);
```
* NOTE - ClassName is case sensitive.
---
### DOM Queries
* Check if there are elements in the nodelist
  before using it.
```javascript
if (elements.length > 0) {
    let firstItem = elements[0];
}
```
---
### DOM Queries
* For a nodelist, even if there is only one node in it,
  you still need to use the array notation to access it:
```javascript
let ele = document.getElementsByTagName('footer');
```
* Even if you are sure there is only one footer on the
  page, you still need to do the following:
```javascript
ele[0].innerHTML += TheHtmlContentToPutIn;
```
---
### DOM Queries 
* The DOM query methods introduced above are
  useful tools for selecting DOM objects in a
  webpage.
* However, their coverage is limited.
* How did we identify elements in CSS?
* Can we use similar methods in JavaScript to select elements?
---
### DOM Queries - CSS Selectors
* Most Commonly Used CSS Selectors
  * Element: `body, p, div, ul, li, section, title`, etc.
  * Id: `#toDoList`
  * Class: `.school`
  * Contextual: `li.school`  (indicates the `li` that has a class name
    `"school"`)
* Review dgl103 for more contextual selector
  options.
---
### DOM Queries - CSS Selectors
* `querySelector('CSS selector')` returns the first
  element in the container that matches the CSS selector,
  or null if nothing is found.
* The container is the node that calls the method. It's
  usually the document but could be another node as well.
* `querySelector('#toDoList');`
  * similar to getElementById ()
* `querySelector('li.school');`
  * If multiple matches exist, only the first one is returned.
---
### DOM Queries - CSS Selectors
* `querySelectorAll('selector')` returns all
  elements in the container that match the CSS selector, or an
  empty nodelist if nothing is found.
  * `document.querySelectorAll('li');`
  * `document.querySelectorAll('.school');`
* This method is similar to `getElementsByTagName()`
  and `getElementsByClassName()`
---
## Working with Elements
---
### Finding Node Content
* An element can contain:
  * Text
  * Child elements
  * Attributes
---
### Finding Node Content
* To access a node's content, you can use:
  * `nodeValue` on textnode (note - each block of text is a textNode)
  * `textContent` to return text content of
    the node and its child nodes.
  * `innerHTML` to return the node's content
    including the markup.
  * Is there an `innerText`? It
    doesn't have a consistent definition across
    browsers.
---
### Finding Node Content - Examples
HTML
```html
<ol id='toDoList'>
  <li class='school'>Homework</li>...
</ol>
```
JS
```javascript
let toDoList = document.querySelector('ol#toDoList');
let li = toDoList.firstElementChild;
let textNode = li.firstChild;
console.log(textNode.nodeValue);
```
---
### Finding Node Content - Examples
HTML
```html
  <li class='school'><em>Homework</em></li>...
```
JS
```javascript
let toDoList = document.querySelector('ol#toDoList');
let li = toDoList.firstElementChild;
//
console.log(li.textContent); // Homework
console.log(li.innerHTML); // <em>Homework<em>
```
---
### Viewing DOM in a Browser
* Modern browsers allow you to view DOM details
  of any component in a page. The info is more
  detailed than you usually need.
* Chrome
  1. Developer Tools panel | Elements tab
  1. Click on the tag to examine
  1. Click on Properties on top of the other pane
* Firefox
  1. Developer Tools | Customize button at upper right
     corner | Settings | select DOM
  1. When inspect a page | DOM on the tool bar
---
## Adding & Removing Elements
---
### Adding Elements
* Follow this 3-step procedure:
  1. Create an element. If applicable, do 1 and 2:
     1. Create the text node for the element
     1. Add the text node as a child to the element
  1. Find the parent for the new element
  1. Add the element to its parent
---
### Adding Elements
* This example will add a li node to toDoList ul
```javascript
// 1. create empty element
const shopping = document.createElement('li');
// 1.1. create text node
const shoppingText = 
    document.createTextNode('shopping'); 
// 1.2 Add the textnode to the element:
shopping.appendChild(shoppingText);
// 2. Find the Parent for the new Elements
let toDoList = 
    document.querySelector('ol#toDoList');
// 3. Add the element to its parent
toDoList.appendChild(shopping);
```
---
### Adding Elements
* The element added to the page will show in the
  browser window right away.
* Step 1 could be done using `textContent` or `innerHTML`
  instead of creating a textNode
```javascript
const shopping =
    document.createElement('li');
//
shopping.textContent = 'shopping';
```
---
### Adding Elements
* An element can be cloned using `cloneNode()`
  method.
* By default, it clones the node's tag and
  attributes.
* To do a deep cloning, i.e., clone its content and
  children, use `true` as the argument when calling
  the method, `node.cloneNode(true)`.
* The cloned node can be added to a parent.
  Make sure no duplicate id is created.
---
### Adding Elements
* Insert an element at a particular position
* `appendChild()` will add the new element as
  the last child of the parent.
* How about if you want to insert an element
  at another position?
* To insert the new element at a flexible
  position, use `insertBefore()`, which inserts
  the new element before the selected
  element in the container.
---
### Adding Elements
* `insertBefore(newnode, existingnode)`
* Insert an element at a particular position, e.g.,
  before the last item in the toDoList.
```javascript
const newli = document.createElement('li');
newli.textContent = 'Exercising';
let toDoList = document.querySelector('ol#toDoList');
let ele = toDoList.lastElementChild;
toDoList.insertBefore(newli, ele);
```
---
### Adding Elements
* There is no insertAfter() method in plain
  JavaScript. However, there is an
  `insertAdjacentElement()` method that does the
  similar job.
* For details ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentElement 
  and https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_insertadjacentelement.asp
---
### Removing Elements
* You can only remove a node from its parent. Do the following:
  1. Find the element and assign it to a variable.
  1. Find the element's parent.
  1. Remove the element from its parent.
```javascript
let ele =
    document.querySelectorAll('li')[2];
let parent = ele.parentNode;
parent.removeChild(ele);
```
---
### Replacing Elements
* You can replace a node with this method:
  `parent.replaceChild(newNode, oldNode)`
* Follow this procedure:
  1. Get the parent node, parent;
  1. Get the node to be replaced, oldNode;
  1. Create a new node, newNode;
  1. Call method, `parent.replaceChild(newNode, oldNode)`
---
### New DOM Methods
* Recent DOM proposal introduced new methods,
  which will make DOM manipulation easier.
  * `node.before(nodes)` inserts nodes just before node
  * `node.after(nodes)` inserts nodes just after node
  * `node.replaceWith(nodes)` replaces node with nodes
  * `node.remove()` removes node itself
* https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-childnode
* Check on https://caniuse.com to see browser
  support.
---
### Live Nodelists
* A live list is dynamically updated. If element is
  added or removed in script at runtime, the list
  will update automatically.
* A live list may impact the performance. if you
  use index to access certain element in the list,
  pay attention to the new content of the list.
* `getElementsByClassName()` and
  `getElementsByTagName()` return a dynamic list.
* `querySelectorAll()` returns a static list.
---
### Live Nodelists
```javascript
let listbytag = 
    document.getElementsByTagName('li');
let listbyselector =
    document.querySelectorAll('li');
```
* These statements produce identical nodelists
  initially.
* Add / remove an item to/from the list.
* Then check listbytag and listbyselector, you will
  see one is updated and the other is not.
---
### Node Operations vs. InnerHTML
* DOM Manipulation (`createElement,createTextNode,appendChild`,...)
  * more coding but will keep doc valid
* `.innerHTML = ...` 
  * simple and flexible but error prone 
  * event listeners added earlier on the elements in innerHTML  
    will be disabled
  * script added this way won't execute
---
## Working with Attributes
---
### Getting Node Attributes
1. Use the `getAttribute("attributeName")` method:
```javascript
document.querySelector('ol').getAttribute('id');
```
1. Use DOM node's attributes property, which
includes all attributes of the node. Each
attribute value can be accessed via its name.
However, IE and some versions of Firefox
don't support it well. 
---
### Getting Attributes 
1. Use a DOM query to select an element:
```javascript
let el = document.querySelector('li');
```
1. Use `getAttribute()` to get the attribute:
```javascript
el.getAttribute('class'); // class assigned
el.getAttribute('src');   // null
```
---
### Updating Attributes
* Multiple methods exist for changing attributes.
```javascript
let first = document.querySelector('li');
first.className = '';
// class is a keyword in JS, so className is used
let third = document.querySelectorAll('li')[2];
// [index] can be used on the nodelist returned
// by the query
third.setAttribute('class', '');
```
---
### Setting Node Class Attribute
* Two methods were introduced for setting the
  class attribute of a node.
* However, they may produce undesirable
  result, if the node belongs to multiple classes.
* The `classList` property is a list of all classes an
  element has. It has methods that make node
  class operation easier.
---
### Setting Node Class Attribute
* `classlist` methods:
```javascript
someNodeVar.classList.add('classname');
someNodeVar.classList.remove('classname');
someNodeVar.classList.toggle('classname');
someNodeVar.classList.contains('classname');
```
* `classList` property is not support by older IE &lt; 10
---
### Removing Attributes
1. Get the element
1. Check for the existence of the attribute, if yes
  then remove it
```javascript
let el = document.getElementById('toDoList');
if (el.hasAttribute('class'))
{
    el.removeAttribute('class');
}
```
---
### Dynamically Loading JS file
* Just add the script element as any other
  element. But the code is unavailable until the
  js file is loaded.
```javascript
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.setAttribute('src', 'newscript.js');
document.appendChild(script);
```
---
### Example - Dynamic Menu
* Extracting all heading text to make a menu on top
  of the page or in a section of your choice.
* When clicking on an item in the menu, it will bring
  the target section to the top of the page.
---
### Summary
* html document is represented with a DOM Tree.
* The tree is made up with nodes, which represent
  the elements of the web document.
* JS code typically works with 4 types of nodes:
* document, element, text, and attribute.
* Typical Node operations
  * Selecting node and updating its content.
  * Adding and removing nodes.
  * Adding, changing, and removing attributes.
