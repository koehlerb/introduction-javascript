## Maintaing State
---
### Objectives
* explain state maintenance techniques
* explain the cookie concepts and purpose
* describe cookie attributes
* set, retrieve and delete cookies
* save multiple data items in a single cookie
* encode and decode cookie data
* use html5 local storage
---
### How HTTP Works
* Users visit webpages in client-server model
  using http / https protocols, which are
  stateless.
* After the server responds to the client
  request with a webpage, or the connection is
  closed depending on the HTTP version, the
  server will lose the client information.

### Maintaining Web States
* Often, keeping the user / visitor state is
  critical for service enhancement and even for
  the normal operations of web applications.
* Common mechanisms for http / https state
  maintenance are cookies and local storage.
  IndexedDB, a new technique, can also be
  used for the same purpose as local storage,
  but it is usually for offline applications.
---
### Cookies
* Cookies, also called document cookies (
  accessed through document object) are small
  files saved with a user's browser.
* Used to store data that can be retrieved
  between http requests, sent to the server as
  part of the http request.
---
### Cookies
* Limits
  * Can be read only by a page from the same domain
    that sets them - a feature.
  * Browsers set the size limit, but RFC 6265 requires a
    browser should support a minimum of 4kb per
    cookie and 50 cookies per domain.
---
### Cookies
* Cookies take the form of a text file that
  contains a list of 'name=value' pairs separated
  by semicolons, such as: 
```javascript
document.cookie = 'name=John;city=Courtenay';
```
* Create Cookies
```javascript
document.cookie = 'cookieName=value';
```
* Run the same statement with a different
  key/value pair will add another cookie, which is
  appended to the existing ones.
---
### Encoding and Decoding Data
* Cookie name/value may not include certain
  characters such as semicolons, commas, and
  whitespace chars. 
* https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
* If they are needed in name/value, you need to
  encode the data using `encodeURIComponent()`
  so that it will be stored correctly.
* After retrieving the cookie, decode the special
  characters using `decodeURIComponent()`.
---
### Encoding and Decoding Data
* Example - you may test this example in a
  browser console:
```javascript
let str = 'Here is a (short) piece of text.';
let str1 = encodeURIComponent(str);
// Here%20is%20a%20(short)%20piece%20of%20text.
let str2 = decodeURIComponent(str1);
// Here is a (short) piece of text.
```
---
### Cookies - Visual Verification
* Browser Developer Tools allow you to view
  document cookies visually.
* Chrome lists them under Application tab.
  However, Chrome doesn't support cookies when
  the page is browsed using file protocol. So, if
  Chrome is your chosen browser, use a local web
  server such as XAMPP or VSCode Live Server
  extension to test this feature.
![Chrome Cookie](chrome-cookie.png)
---
### Cookies - Visual Verification
* Firefox shows them under Storage tab.
* Firefox supports session cookies even if the page
  is browsed locally with the file protocol. If the
  visual inspection tool doesn't work, try the
  console, which seems more reliable.
* In the browser console, just type
  document.cookie, it will show all cookies
  accessible to the current page.
![Firefox Cookie](firefox-cookie.png)
---
### Updating Cookie Values
* Change Cookie Value
```javascript
document.cookie = 'cookieName=value';
```
* If you use a cookie name that already exists, it
  will use the new value to replace the existing
  one.

NOTE - cookie name is case sensitive.
---
### Retrieving Cookies
* Retrieve Cookies
```javascript
const cookies = document.cookie;
```
* `document.cookie` returns a string that
  includes all cookies accessible to the current
  webpage.
* Then you can extract individual cookies from
  the string - discussed later in this document.
---
### Cookie Attributes
* Other than the cookie name, you may
  also set attributes of a cookie such as
  * expires / max-age
  * path
  * domain
  * secure
* The attributes are listed after
  `key=value`, delimited by ';'.
* Cookie attribute names are case-
  insensitive.
---
### Cookie Attribute - Expires
* By default, cookies are deleted once a
  browser session is finished (all
  windows/tabs of the same browser are
  closed, or after a certain time, e.g., 20mins).
  These type of cookies are called session
  cookies.
* To extend its existence, add
  `"expires=date"` to the end of the cookie
  when it's created.
---
### Cookie Attribute - Expires
* The date should be in the UTC (Coordinated
  Universal Time) String format:
  "Day, dd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss GMT"
```javascript
document.cookie = 'name=JohnDoe;expires=Mon, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT';
```
* As the UTC string format is a little hard to
  remember, it might be better to start with
  today's date.
---
### Cookie Attribute - Expires
```javascript
//create new date obj with system date & time
const expiryDate = new Date();
//add 24 hours (milliseconds) to the date obj
const tomorrow = expiryDate.getTime() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
//set expiryDate to tomorrow
expiryDate.setTime(tomorrow);
document.cookie = 
  `name=JohnDoe;expires=${expiryDate.toUTCString()}`;
```
---
### Cookie Attribute - Max-Age
* `expires` takes a date string and is supported by
  all browsers including old IEs.
* The newer `max-age` is easier to use and is also
  widely supported. It takes a value of the number
  of seconds counted from the cookie creation
  time.
```javascript
const tomorrow = 60 * 60 * 24;
document.cookie = `name=JohnDoe;max-age=${tomorrow}`;
```
---
### Cookie Attributes - Path and Domain
* By default, cookies can only be read by pages
  inside the same directory as the file sets it.
* Add the string `'; path=/'` to the cookie to allow
  all pages on the site to access the cookie.
* Add `'; domain=rootDomainName'` to the cookie to
  allow pages of all subdomains under the root
  domain of the page to access the cookie.
* Add `'; secure'` to the end of a cookie will ensure
  it's only transmitted over HTTPS.
* NOTE - need a web server to test the last 2 features.
---
### References - Cookie Attributes
* JavaScript API, which is the interface to http
  cookies, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies/Cookie
* Http Cookie, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
* RFC 6265 HTTP State Management Mechanism - more technical https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265
---
### Example - Creating Cookies
```javascript
function createCookie(name,value,days,path,domain,secure) {
  let maxage;
  if (days) maxage = days * 24 * 60 * 60;
  let cookieStr = `${name}=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`;
  if (maxage) cookieString += `; max-age=${maxage}`
  if (path) cookieStr += 
    `; path = ${encodeURIComponent(path)}`; 
  if (domain) cookieStr += 
    `; domain = ${encodeURIComponent(domain)}`; 
  if (secure) cookieStr += "; secure"; 
  document.cookie = cookieStr; // create the cookie
}
```
---
### Reading Multiple Cookies
* A cookie is stored as a string; within it there are
  multiple "name=value" pairs.
* To read the value of a cookie we need to separate
  these "name=value" pairs using string method `split()`,
  which produces an array of "name=value" pairs;
```javascript
var crumbs = document.cookie.split(';');
```
* Browsers usually use “; “ to separate cookies.
* NOTE - `document.cookie` only reveals cookie
  names and values but no other info such as path,
  expires, etc.
---
### Extracting Cookie Values
* For a particular cookie, we need to go 
  through the "name=value" array to find it:
```javascript
function getCookie(name) {
    let cookies = document.cookie.split(";");
    for (let cookie of cookies) {
      let cookieParts = cookie.split("=");
      if (cookieParts[0].trim() == name) {
        return decodeURIComponent(cookieParts[1].trim()); 
      }
    } //end of for loop
    return null;
}
```
---
### Deleting Cookies
* Just need to set its expiry time to before now, the
  browser will remove it. Please note, some browsers may
  delay the cookie removal until your session is over.
```javascript
function deleteCookie(name) {
    createCookie(name, "", -1);
}
```
* Creating the same named cookie will overwrite the
  existing one. Setting the expires to -1 means to expire it
  asap, though this may not happen until the browser is
  closed.
---
### Deleting Cookies
* To remove a cookie, set it to expire at a time in
  the past:
```javascript
document.cookie = 
    'name=JohnDoe; expires=Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:01 GMT';
```
* or, set its `max-age` to 0:
```javascript
document.cookie = 'name=JohnDoe; max-age=0';
```
---
### Multiple Values in a Cookie
* Each cookie contains one "name=value" pair.
* To store multiple pieces of data such as a user's
  name, age, and email, you need three different
  cookies, which could be undesirable.
* To have multiple values in one cookie, the idea is
  to separate the values in the cookie's value
  portion with a delimiter. When reading the
  cookie, extract each piece out of the value
  string.
---
### Multiple Values in a Cookie
```javascript
function mvCookie() {
    let userName = prompt("Enter your name please:");
    let email = prompt("Enter your email please:");
    document.cookie = 
      `user=${userName}|${email}; max-age=3600;`;
    document.querySelector( "#output" ).innerHTML =
      `<p>Multi-valued Cookie created: 
          user=${userName}|${email};</p>`;
}
```
---
### Cookie vs. Data Privacy
* Cookies are stored with a client browser but
  transmitted to servers when making a http req.
* EU and many countries require explicit user
  consent for collecting user info with cookie.
* However, strictly necessary cookies are exempted
  from this.
* For details, ref. these sites:
  * https://www.captaincompliance.com/education/strictly-necessary-cookies
  * https://www.privacypolicies.com/cookie-consent/

## Web Storage API
---
### Web Storage API
* Web storage (or localStorage) is a feature of
  HTML5.
* It lets you store data in client browser.
* The data it stores can only be accessed by
  the domain that sets the data.
---
### Web Storage API
* There are two types of storage: *local* and
  *session* storage.
* They are implemented using the
  `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects.
---
### Web Storage API
* Both local and session storages have the
  same methods to get and set data, but each
  lasts a different amount of time.
* `sessionStorage` data is deleted at the end of
  the session - when the browser or tab is
  closed. 
* `localStorage` data stays unless it's explicitly
  deleted by the user or by JS code.
---
### Web Storage API
* `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are accessed
via the `window` object.
* Save Data
```javascript
localStorage.setItem(key, value);
sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
```
* Retrieve Data
```javascript
localStorage.getItem(key);
sessionStorage.getItem(key);
```
---
### Web Storage API
* Clear all saved data
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
```
* Remove one item
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem(key)
sessionStorage.removeItem(key)
```

---
### Web Storage API
* Like cookies, both key and value for
  local/session storage are strings.
* If you need to store objects, serialize it
  before saving the data and deserialize it
  after retrieving the data.
---
### Web Storage Verification
* Like document cookies, web storage info can
  be checked with Browsers Developer Tools,
  either visually or in the browser's console.
* For example, to view the storage content, in
  the browser console tool, type
```javascript
localStorage // or
sessionStorage
```
---
### Web Storage Example
```javascript
function checkStorage() {
  let color;
  if (window.localStorage) {
    color = localStorage.getItem("color");
    if (color) alert(`your favorite color is ${color}`);
    else {
      color = prompt("what's your favorite color?");
      if (color) {
        localStorage.setItem("color", color);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
---
### Cookies vs. localStorage
* Both store information on the client side and
  both can only be accessed by the same
  domain pages/files.
* Cookies are smaller (about 4kb) and localStorage
  is larger (about 5mb).
* Cookies send info back to server with every
  HTTP request while localStorage doesn't.
* Cookie has an expiry date while localStorage
  doesn't set it explicitly.

### IndexedDB
* IndexedDB is a database built into a browser, 
  much more powerful than localStorage. 
  It's typically used for offline apps.
* Version 1.0 was released as a W3 Recommendation in 2015.
