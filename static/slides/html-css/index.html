## Programming HTML and CSS
---
### Objectives
* Control video and audio playback
* Use the DOM element's style property
* Retrieve and set styles
* Use the DOM styleSheets object
* Enable, disable, and switch stylesheets in
  JavaScript
* Work with CSS3 properties and animations
---
## Programming HTML 
---
### HTML5 Video Element
```html
<video id="vid1" width="400" height="300" controls="controls">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
  <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>Video tag not supported.</p>
</video>
```
* Ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video
---
### HTML5 Video Element
* Control playback using the `pause()` and
  `play()` methods:
```javascript
let myVideo = document.getElementById('vid1').play();
let myVideo = document.getElementById('vid1').pause();
```
* For the `play()` method to work, newer browsers
  require that either your app has received the
  user permission for auto play, or the user has
  interacted with the page, such as click on the
  page, etc. But muted auto-play is always
  allowed. https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/
---
### HTML5 Audio Element
```html
<audio controls="controls">
  <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio
     element.</p>
</audio>
```
* Ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
---
### HTML5 Audio Element
* Controlling Playback using
  the `pause()` and `play()` methods:
```javascript
let myAudio = document.getElementById('aud1').play();
let myAudio = document.getElementById('aud1').pause();
```
* To add audio to a page using JavaScript:
```javascript
let myAudio = document.createElement('audio');
myAudio.setAttribute('src', 'sound.ogg');
document.querySelector('main').appendChild(myAudio);
```
---
### Video and Audio Properties
* video and audio elements have common
  properties that can be accessed or controlled by
  JavaScript, https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp
---
## Manipulating CSS with JavaScript
---
### Updating CSS
* Every element has a style property, which can
  be used to set the CSS of the element:
```javascript
let ele = document.getElementById('toDoList');
ele.style.color= 'blue';
```
* NOTE - you cannot apply a style to a node list
  directly; do one element at a time.
---
### Updating CSS
* Any CSS property name that includes a dash must
  be written in camelCase notation:
```javascript
toDoList.style.backgroundColor = 'gray';
```
* Alternatively, you can use [ ] notation with CSS
  syntax:
```javascript
toDoList.style[background-color]= 'yellow';
```
* You can also move the sub-property to the right
  side of =, but not recommended:
```javascript
toDoList.style = 'background-color: yellow';
```
---
### Retrieving CSS
* `ele.style` can retrieve the element's inline styles 
  and styles assigned by JavaScript.
* Function `getComputedStyle(element)` will
  retrieve all styles of the element, including embedded 
  and external CSS assigned to the element:
```javascript
let ele = document.querySelector('ul');
let styles = getComputedStyle(ele);
```
* Then individual styles can be accessed using the dot notation:
```javascript
console.log(styles.color);
```
---
### Retrieving CSS
* NOTE - The computed styles are read-only.
---
### CSS Style vs. Classes
* using `ele.style` property allows you to set element
  styles at runtime but it's hard to maintain.
* A better and recommended approach is to
  change the class of an element and keep the
  relevant styles for each class in a stylesheet.
---
### CSS Style vs. Classes
* A class can be assigned to an element in
  multiple ways:
```javascript
ele.setAttribute('class', 'classA' ); //IE >= 8.0
ele.className = 'classA';
```
* A better approach is to use classList property
  (discussed previously)
```javascript
ele.classList.add('classA'); //IE >= 10.0
ele.classList.remove('classA'); //IE >= 10.0
```
---
### document styleSheets Property
* The `document.styleSheets` property contains
  all stylesheets linked or embedded to the
  page.
* The stylesheets are added to the collection in
  the order of their presence in the page.
* You can use a regular loop to go through the
  list but cannot use Array methods such as
  `find()`, `indexOf()`, etc. on it.
---
### document styleSheets Property
* Each element in the collection has a `disabled`
  property, which indicates whether the
  stylesheet will apply to the page.
* We can use this feature to provide the user
  with theme selections.
* This feature is relatively new, check browser
  compatibility before use, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/styleSheets#Browser_compatibility
---
### Selecting a Style Sheet
* We can use buttons or a dropdown list for the
  user to select a preferred stylesheet.
* Make each button or list item to match a
  particular stylesheet or an index in the
  `styleSheets` collection. Then disable all styles 
  except for the selected one.
* Detailed implementation is left for your own
  practice.
---
## Special Effects and Animations
---
### Advanced Control of CSS
* We will use JavaScript to set CSS3 properties
  in coordination with CSS to achieve special
  effects.
---
### CSS3 Transitions - Review
* To create transition, use the following
  transition style:
```text  
transition: property duration
timing-function delay;
```
where,
* `property` is a property of the object that
  changes between the initial and end states;
* `duration` is the transition time in seconds (s)
  or milliseconds (ms).
---
### CSS3 Transition - Review
* `timing-function` is one of the following
  keywords: `ease`: (the default),
  `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`,
  and `linear`.
* `delay` is measured in seconds (s) or
  milliseconds (ms).
---
### Example
* When an element is clicked on, hide the
  element by changing its opacity to 0 and
  make the process last for 2 seconds.
* Implementation
  * Set an element's transition effect on opacity in
    CSS.
  * Change the opacity of an element in JS
* How to make the click toggle between
  show and hide of the element?
---
### Example
* When an element is clicked on, move the
  element off the screen to the right side.
* Implementation
  * Set an element's transition effect on property
    `left` in CSS.
  * Change the leftproperty in JS. Note: the
    `left` property value must be a string with a
    unit, e.g., px or em.
  * CSS positioning on the element must be
    enabled.
---
### Example
* How to move the element off the screen then
  bring it back to where it was?
* Implementation
  * after the first change on `left` then use
    `setTimeout()` method to call another
    function to change the element's `left` back to
    the original position.
---
### Animation - CSS vs. JS
* JavaScript is more powerful and flexible.
  However, CSS does have some basic
  animation tools such as transform, transition,
  and keyframe animation.
* Whenever possible, the CSS option is preferred
---
### Animation - Example
* The `setTimeOut()` and `setInterval()` methods 
  are often used to animate elements on
  a web page.
* At each time interval, motion will occur.
  1. HTML file — structures the page component, a square
  1. CSS file — defines the square's size and background color
  1. JS file — in `setInterval()` method, specifies
     the angle changes at each interval,
     then use the transform stye to rotate the square
---
### Animation — Example
* This site has good coverage on JS
  animations, https://javascript.info/js-animation
* View the Source Code, then check out the
  CSS and JS file to see the implementation.
---
### Animation - Example - CSS
```css
#square {
  margin: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: #d16;
}
```
---
### Animation - Example - JS
```javascript
const squareElement = document.getElementById('square');
let angle = 0;
setInterval( () => {
  angle = (angle + 2) % 360;
  squareElement.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`
}, 1000/60);
```
---
### Animation
* `requestAnimationFrame()` is a better
  method than `setInterval()` for animation as
  it optimizes the performance.
* This approach doesn't set the frame rate. The frame rate 
  is usually 60 per second.
* Your code will call
  `requestAnimationFrame(rotate)`, where
  `rotate` is a function name.
* In the `rotate` function, it will make one move 
  and call the method again at the end.
* For details, ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
---
### Animation - Example
```javascript
const squareElement = document.getElementById('square');
let angle = 0;
//
function rotate() {
  angle = (angle + 2)%360;
  squareElement.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`
  window.requestAnimationFrame(rotate);
}
//
const id = requestAnimationFrame(rotate);
```
---
### Animation - CSS @keyframe
```css
#square {
  margin: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: #cc0;
  animation: spin 4s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  from {transform:rotate(0deg); }
  to {transform:rotate(360deg);}
}
```
---
### Animation - Fading Effect
Often you can combine CSS and JS to do it.
1. Assign the element a class, e.g., invisible.
1. Use CSS to set the opacity for the class.
1. Set the transition on opacity to the element
   that has the class, but not the class itself.
1. Use `setTimeout` to remove the class from
   the element.
---
### Animation - Example - CSS
Creating a Fading Effect

CSS file - if the element (h1) to fade/appear

```css
.hide {
  opacity: 0;
}

h1 {
  transition: opacity 2s;
}
```

Position and transform effect can also be
achieved in similar way.
---
### Animation - Example - JS
Creating a Fading Effect

Click on an element to trigger fading event handler

```javascript
function fading(e) {
  e.target.classList.add('hide');
  /* the 3rd argument in the setTimeout() below is passed
     into function show() so that it can directly work on the
     event target. */
  setTimeout(show, 2000, e.target);
}
//
function show(ele) {
  //ele parameter is the e.target passed in
  ele.classList.remove('hide');
}
```

## Drawing and Accessing Local Files - Reference Only
---
### Drawing with canvas
* Canvas is a rectangular area in a page where
  you can:
  * draw shapes and graphics.
  * load and display image files and control their display.
  * Practical applications includes dynamic charts,
    JavaScript/HTML games, and animations.
  * https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_reference.asp
---
### Drawing with Canvas
* Drawing Example
* Clock example https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_clock_start
---
### Processing Local Files - Optional
* JavaScript cannot directly access user local files
  on its own.
* However, if user selects a file via 
```html
<input type="file">
```
  or drag and drop, then JavaScript can
  access the information of these files selected by
  user.
---
### Summary
* Program video and audio element
* Use the DOM style property
* Retrieve and set styles
* Access classes using className
* Enable, disable, and switch stylesheets in
  JavaScript
* Working with CSS3 properties
---
### Summary
* Simple animations
* draw with the `<canvas>` element - optional
* interface with the local file system - optional
